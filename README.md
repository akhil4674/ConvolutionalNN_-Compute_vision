# Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow 🚀

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing cutting-edge computer vision techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Overview 📚

Learn to preprocess image datasets, build and train CNN models, apply transfer learning, and visualize results using TensorFlow. Key highlights:

- End-to-end implementation: from data loading to model evaluation.
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, VGG16).
- Clear visualizations of results and performance metrics.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Ensure the following are installed:

- Python (>= 3.8)
- TensorFlow (>= 2.x)
- Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Dataset 📊

Uses popular image datasets like:

- **CIFAR-10**: 60,000 32x32 images across 10 classes.
- **MNIST**: Handwritten digit images.

Datasets are automatically handled with TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS).
