# Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow 🚀

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing state-of-the-art computer vision techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It is part of the **TensorFlow Developer Course** from **Zero to Mastery (ZTM)**.

## Overview 📚

The notebook explores the core concepts of computer vision and demonstrates the application of CNNs for image classification and feature extraction using TensorFlow. The repository is designed to help learners understand how to:

- Preprocess image datasets for deep learning tasks.
- Build, train, and evaluate CNN models in TensorFlow.
- Apply transfer learning to improve model performance.
- Visualize and interpret the results of CNN models.

## Key Features 🌟

- **End-to-End Implementation**: Covers the entire workflow from data loading to model evaluation.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models to boost performance.
- **Practical Examples**: Hands-on coding exercises to solidify understanding.
- **Visualization**: Clear and detailed visualization of results and intermediate steps.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- TensorFlow (>= 2.x)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Dataset 📊

The notebook uses publicly available image datasets such as:

- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- **MNIST**: Handwritten digits dataset (for additional exercises).

Datasets are automatically downloaded and managed via TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS).
